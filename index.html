      <h3>My background</h3>
      <p>
        Due to my background in engineering and the hard sciences, I know how
        to write all the technical stuff you can imagine.
<br><br>
        But as a naturally
        good communicator, I retain my jovial and captivating tone and can
        make the most difficult subject fun and interesting to read.
        <br /><br />
        I have a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and a master's in
        physics and I have an in-depth understanding of the principles of
        structural analysis and engineering design.
<br><br>
        I have worked in
        construction as a site supervisor, in the supply chain industry as a
        warehouse staff, and also in home cleaning services.

        <br /><br />I also have working knowledge of front-end web development, with
        in-depth knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and front-end JavaScript, and some
        knowledge of React.js and node.js.

        <br>In fact, I designed and hosted this website myself.

        <br /><br />I have been writing in various capacities for over eight
        years, starting initially as a hobby, and now professionally.

        <br /><br />On turning professional, I have taken writing courses on
        coursera.org, and have studied many good books and resources on
        professional writing, copywriting, technical writing, search engine
        optimization, and freelancing.

        <br /><br />I still learn a lot and plan to continually study more
        material and take more courses in the spirit of continuous learning and
        self-development, so I can serve you better.
      </p>

      <h3>My writing experience</h3>

      <p>I can write in any voice or tone.</p>
      <p>
        I have done blog posts, technical writing, product descriptions, and product
        manuals for engineering, technology, and construction.
