        <p>

            “Located in Hubei province, this dam is home to the largest hydroelectric power station on the planet, capable of generating 22,500 MW of power.
        </p>

        <p>

            When full, the water level reaches 175 meters above sea level and 95 meters above river level.
        </p>

        <p>

            The reservoir created by this dam has the potential to flood up to 632 square kilometers of surface area with a total of 42 billion metric tons of water. NASA scientists confirm that when the dam fills, it triggers a phenomenon known as the inertia moment, which affects the Earth's rotation.
        </p>

        <p>

            According to researchers, the entire dam slows down the Earth's rotation, increasing the length of a day by 0.06 microseconds and even altering the planet's shape, making it slightly rounder at the center and flatter at the poles!”

            </blockquote>
        </p>

<p>

    Information and accurate statistics about the Three Gorges Dam and the dangers it poses to the earth can be obtained from the official website of the <a href="https://eros.usgs.gov/earthshots/">

        United States Geological Services (USCS).
    </a>
</p>

<p>

    This is a very brief example of what heavy construction projects such as these can do to the earth.
</p>

<p>

    Seemingly little effects from many projects like this can combine and gradually build up with time to produce devastating effects.
</p>

<p>

    In March 2003, Paul K. Gellert and Barbara D. Lynch, both assistant professors at Cornell University published an article titled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296949207_Mega-projects_as_displacements">Mega-projects as Displacements</a>. They defined mega-projects “as those which transform landscapes rapidly, intentionally, and profoundly, in very visible ways.”
</p>

<p>

    The Three Gorges Dam described above can therefore be described as a mega-project.
</p>

<p>

    Many other mega-projects have pronounced effects on the earth in one way or another, though they may not all be as heavy as the Three Gorges Dam.
</p>

<p>

    In essence, huge projects such as dams, roads, railways, skyscrapers, stadiums, amphitheaters, ports, mines, factories, etc., all have pronounced effects on the earth.
</p>

<p>

    Their effects could be on the visible landscape of their surrounding, by the emissions of greenhouse gases, or even through toxic waste, runoffs, and wastewater produced by many industries and factories.
</p>

<p>

    Yet, we're still building.
</p>

<p>

    Today's advanced society certainly has the highest earning power in recorded history.
</p>

<p>

    Even at that, many people still live in poverty, resulting in global efforts to alleviate poverty.
</p>

<p>

These factors combined with our inborn tendency to continually pursue higher levels of comfort drive increasing demand for better infrastructure.
</p>

<p>

    And this means that engineering constructions will persist. Their need and demand cannot be overstated and will not wane any time soon.
</p>

<p>

    Many projects are outright necessities. Some are done for mere commercial reasons, to expand the already deep pockets of developers and contractors. While others are simply feats of vanity. Furthermore, already-built infrastructure has to be continually maintained, repaired and upgraded.
</p>

<p>

    So, even beyond the special focus on huge landscape-altering projects, from the production processes of the construction materials to onsite installations, and service life of infrastructure, construction has a lot of impact on the environment.
</p>

<p>

    Many of these impacts are negative. Concrete, steel, aluminum, timber, and glass, for example, are the most used construction materials.
</p>

<p>

    This is largely due to their comparative advantage over other materials.
</p>

<p>

    With today's technology, they can be mass-produced to meet the high demand.
</p>

<p>

    We can form, shape, and install them however we want.
</p>

<p>

    And their structural behavior is very good.
</p>

<p>

    Yet they have negative effects on the ecosystem.
</p>

<p>

    Cement concrete alone, being the most used material in building construction accounts for about 8 percent of CO2 emissions globally.
</p>

<p>

    This is due to Portland cement being used as the binding material in most concrete.
</p>

<p>

    Neither are the bituminous materials used in asphalt concrete for most roads and a few roofing systems much better.
</p>

<p>

    The use of timber in construction leads to deforestation.
</p>

<p>

    Steel and aluminum involve mining, with all the environmental issues that result from mining.—
</p>

<p>

    They are also subject to rusting and litter the earth's surface with corrosive metal waste when they go out of use.
</p>

<p>

    So the role of civil engineering and engineers in determining a sustainable future for global infrastructure cannot be overestimated.
</p>

<h3>

    Civil engineers define infrastructure projects:
</h3>

<ul class="list">
    <li>

        They identify and plan new projects.
    </li>
    <li>

        They analyze and design the structural members of the projects.
    </li>
    <li>

        They also design the envelopes and facades of the projects.
    </li>
    <li>

        They have to choose cost-efficient and durable materials and construction methods for the projects.
    </li>
    <li>

        They have to maintain, repair, and upgrade existing infrastructure.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>

    So, much responsibility for our sustainable future lies on the industry leaders in this field.
</p>

<p>

    Let's break down some of the aspects where innovative civil engineering can further the global efforts towards sustainability.
</p>

<h3>

    The role of civil engineering in defining infrastructure projects: environmental impact assessment
</h3>

<p>

    Civil and environmental engineering play principal roles in the development and implementation of city laws and codes for all infrastructure.
</p>

<p>

    Small projects like residential buildings have a low impact on the environment, unlike the huge mega-projects with costly effects on the environment.
</p>

<p>

    Yet before any project is developed, whether small or mega, state and city laws and codes must be obeyed.
</p>

<p>

    This is ensured through laws that prohibit the erection of any structure without the express approval of the city and state boards.
</p>

<p>

    So an application for approval with government bodies in charge of such projects must be made first by the developers.
</p>

<p>

    Development work can only commence if such approval is issued.
</p>

<p>

    Any violations are punished by stringent laws.
</p>

<p>

    For example, the City Building Division of St Louis must issue a Residential Construction Permit to the developers before any residential building is erected in St. Louis.
</p>

<p>

    To issue such permits, the division has to survey project plans and investigation reports to ensure that the projects meet city codes and standards.
</p>

<p>

    In their self-description on their website, the <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/departments/buildings-safety-engineering-and-environmental-department/bseed-divisions/construction-inspection">

        Construction Inspection Division
    </a>
    of the city of Detroit explained their work like so:
</p>

<p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote1">

        The Construction Inspection Division is responsible for performing inspections on construction activities to ensure that construction projects meet approved plans and comply with building codes and standards.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>

    Government bodies like these, both at city, state, and national levels ensure that new infrastructure follows prescribed regulations.
</p>

<p>

    Some of them work to regulate things like connection to the electricity grid, water grid, gas and telecommunications network, etc.
</p>

<p>

    Environmental agencies also ensure that projects do not have too many negative impacts on the environment.
</p>

<p>

    Environmental impact assessments (EIA) have to be conducted for all mega-projects to ascertain the benefits and demerits. Sometimes entire projects are canceled due to excessive potential damage to the environment.
</p>

<p>

    <a href="https://unece.org/DAM/env/eia/documents/StudyEffectivenessEA.pdf">

        United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
    </a>
    conducted a study that revealed that in about half of the reported cases, environmental impact assessments cause changes to project plans and specifications.
</p>

<p>

    Their studies revealed that following the changes made due to EIAs generates better results for our future sustainability
</p>

<p>

    The idea of conducting <a href="https://utilitiesone.com/the-importance-of-environmental-impact-assessments-in-civilengineering#:~:text=EIAs%20ensure%20compliance%20with%20environmental,minimize%20ha%20rm%20to%20the%20environment">EIAs</a> for infrastructure projects is popular among the US public who regard it as essential to the protection of the environment.
</p>

<p>

    However, following the results and recommendations of EIAs and obeying city laws and codes can be expensive for developers.
</p>

<p>

    And sometimes developers cut corners to the detriment of the ecosystem.
</p>

<p>

    The hope is that developers will become more conscientious about their practices observe every code and follow guidelines and recommendations. It is for the benefit and assurance of our future.
</p>

<p>

    Whether on the side of the developers, in government bodies, or with nongovernmental activists, the skills of civil engineers and the application of civil engineering are the bedrock of any activity involving infrastructure.
</p>

<h3>

    The Role of Civil Engineering in Sustainable Structural Analysis and Design of Infrastructure
</h3>

<p>


    Many engineering design and construction firms now make efforts to prepare building designs using highly durable materials with low environmental impact. Efforts are also being made to use materials that can easily be recycled.
</p>

<p>

    This is very important given the environmental consequences of concrete, steel, aluminum, and timber which remain the most common building materials.
</p>

<h4>

    Understanding CONCRETE
</h4>

<p>
<a href="https://psci.princeton.edu/tips/2020/11/3/cement-and-concrete-the-environmental-impact">

    Concrete is the most used material on earth, only behind water.
</a>
</p>

<p>

    The structural versatility of concrete has enabled us to build every kind of structure imaginable. From bridges to dams, roads and railways to airports, long-span buildings to high rises, and even underwater structures, the use of concrete in construction is just ubiquitous.
</p>

<p>

    But as stated earlier in this article, there are a lot of CO2 emissions due to concrete.
    <a href="https://www.solidiatech.com/products/">

        The annual emissions are just over 4 billion tonnes per year.
    </a>
</p>

<p>

    The problem with concrete is not the fine and coarse aggregates but the Portland cement used in conjunction with water to bind the aggregates in a mixed design to produce the concrete.
</p>

<p>

    This is because of the high CO2 emissions during the production of Portland cement---Portland cement is made by heating limestone and other materials in a furnace. It is during this process that high emissions occur. This is because of the energy used to generate the enormous heat for burning limestone, and the chemical reactions that occur in the furnace while the cement is being produced.
</p>

<p>

    Stakeholders are working hard to improve the methods used in manufacturing cement.
</p>

<p>

    And civil engineering experts also have a role to play in the way they design structures.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.solidiatech.com/products/">


        Solida, a cement manufacturing company based in New Jersey has devised a means to reduce their CO2 emissions during the cement manufacturing process by up to 30%.
    </a>
    They use lower production temperatures of around 1250°C compared to the usual 1450°C. They also produce cement with lower limestone content which gains more strength when exposed to C02 and water.
</p>

<p>

    So due to how they produce it, their cement absorbs some CO2 back unlike Portland cement.
</p>

<p>

    Their cement is cheaper and can outperform Portland cement in design and construction.
</p>

<p>

    Environmentally conscious engineers and developers will resort to the use of less harmful cement products from companies like Solida over Portland cement.
</p>

<p>

    Certainly, the structural performance of cement concrete is so good that it is nearly impossible to replace it.
</p>

<p>

    However, many design firms try to incorporate more open spaces in their designs and try to use other materials as concrete binders wherever possible.
</p>

<p>

    The use of novel materials materials such as hempcrete can go a long way in reducing the use of Portland cement.
</p>

<p>

    Hempcrete is made from a mixture of hemp hurds, lime, and other materials.
</p>

<p>

    It can be used for non-load-bearing walls in buildings.
</p>

<p>

    The bricks and masonry blocks made from hemp outperform their Portland cement counterparts.
</p>

<p>

    They are very resilient and durable and have very high fire resistance since the hemp in the hempcrete will not burn.
</p>

<p>

    No matter how tiny, any reduction in the carbon footprint of the global infrastructure through better and more conscientious design and material selection will go a long way.
</p>

<p>

    The little benefits will add up in the long term.
</p>

<h4>

    Understanding ASPHALT
</h4>

<p>

    Bitumen is the cementitious material used in asphalt concrete. Together with water, it is used to bind coarse and fine aggregates together for paving roads.
</p>

<p>

    Asphalt concrete is the most used material for road surface construction. With over 5.5 million kilometers of road in Europe alone, mainly paved using asphalt, the use of asphalt raises environmental issues.
</p>

<p>

    Because bitumen, as the binder in asphalt, is a petroleum product. And the petroleum industry is responsible for the majority of the carbon emissions today.
<a href="https://biofabrik.com/biobitumen/#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20bitumen%2C%20the,of%20the%20largest%20CO2%20sinks.">

    The processes surrounding the production of bitumen itself generate up to 30 megatons of CO2 into the atmosphere.
</a>
</p>

<p>

    However, the efforts being made to reduce the carbon footprint of bitumen are seeing light with companies such as Biofabrik now able to manufacture safer bitumen, which they refer to as Biotumen. Their Biotumen is made from natural resources and is 10 times more durable than the usual bitumen made from crude oil.
</p>

<p>

    One tonne of Biotumen from Biofrabrik is capable of trapping up to 1.512kg of CO2. This means it reabsorbs CO2 from the atmosphere.
</p>

<p>

    A very positive result that engineering design and construction firms can take into account while selecting materials for use in road construction and maintenance.
</p>

<p>

    Little by little, through careful selection of construction materials, civil engineering experts can propel the future of earth’s sustainability.
</p>

<h4>

    Understanding STEEL
</h4>

<p>

    For its strength and durability, steel is one of the best construction materials. But its CO2 emissions are very high.
</p>

<p>

    Steel is made by heating iron ores with coke. Meanwhile, coke comes from coal and produces very high environmental pollution.
</p>

<p>

    A lot of effort is being made to improve the processes for producing steel.
</p>

<p>

    So no matter how difficult, conscientious engineers try to reduce dependence on steel in the selection and design of construction materials.
</p>

<p>

    An example is in the use of timber where possible.
</p>

<p>

    Most engineers prefer to use timber for beams and roof trusses in small residential constructions that require lower load-bearing capacities.
</p>

<p>

    Scaffolding is very important during construction. Scaffolds enable construction site workers to climb and have access to high and obscure corners during construction works.
</p>

<p>

    In construction sites, the steel scaffolds are installed carefully during construction. This allows them to be dismantled carefully and recycled for use in other construction projects.
</p>

<p>

    Also in many African countries, bamboo sticks are used for scaffolding during construction instead of steel.
</p>

<p>

    Bamboo sticks are cheap, strong, and resilient materials that grow out of bamboo trees.
</p>

<p>

    Using them for scaffolding saves on material and installation costs of steel scaffolds and also reduces the overall carbon footprint of projects.
</p>

<p>

    Designers and construction managers also make use of materials such as plastic pipes in place of steel pipes.
</p>

<p>

    Plastic and rubber pipes are cheaper, very lightweight easy to transport, and corrosion resistant, unlike steel pipes.
</p>

<p>

    They are also better at preventing the loss of heat for the transported fluid and are much more durable than steel pipes which struggle in wet environments.
</p>

<p>

    So plastic and rubber pipes offer better sustainability advantages and have long been incorporated into construction for conveying fluids.
</p>
<p>

    These alternatives still cannot reduce the importance of steel in construction.
</p>

<p>

    In certain instances, only the characteristics of steel, such as its high tensile strength and ductility can allow design engineers to achieve the desired results.
</p>

<p>

    When designing for extreme loading, earthquakes, and high tensile forces, nothing beats steel.
</p>

<p>

    Steel bars make the versatile use of concrete possible in the first place.
</p>

<p>

    Because concrete is very strong in compression but weak in tension, it is not great at surviving extreme tensile loads.
</p>

<p>

    Steel bars are used to reinforce the concrete so that the tensile forces can be borne by the steel rebars.
</p>

<p>

    Also, steel frames are used for most high-rise constructions and buildings in environments with the potential to suffer from earthquakes.
</p>

<p>

    This means that steel will continue to be an important construction material.
</p>

<p>

    Manufacturers must therefore develop better methods for producing steel to reduce the environmental impact.
</p>

<h3>

    The role of civil engineering in improved construction management
</h3>

<p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote1">
        <a href="https://www.levelengineering.com/structural-engineering/sustainable-structural-engineering/amp/">

            Construction projects account for 40% of carbon emissions and 36% of the energy used globally.
        </a>
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>

    Improved construction management methods would streamline the construction processes.
</p>

<p>

    This will result in faster delivery of projects and the use of less, more energy-efficient, and highly durable materials in construction.
</p>

<p>

    By employing superior construction management techniques, higher energy efficiency, and reduced financial and environmental costs could be achieved.
</p>

<p>

    For instance, construction managers can find ways to use less energy during construction.
</p>

<p>

    Building information modeling (BIM), and intelligent application of virtual and augmented reality technologies in construction is a way forward now.
</p>

<p>

    Many construction site workers now use wearable technologies onsite for improved and faster workflow and greater safety and protection for the site workers.
</p>

<p>

    Artificial intelligence is gaining rapid traction in construction management and is gradually being integrated into every stage of infrastructure development.
</p>

<h3>

    Some novel materials and techniques for green infrastructure and building construction
</h3>

<h4>

    Fungi
</h4>

<p>

    The science of developing bricks and cladding for building walls using mycelium fungi is being pursued with earnest efforts.
</p>

<p>

    Fungus-made buildings will be considerably cheaper and lightweight.
</p>

<p>

    Because fungus is a living organism, construction materials made from fungus are 100% biodegradable. The materials will grow in strength continually and can be induced to perform self-repair.
</p>

<p>

    Fungus materials are also fire and heat-resistant, waterproof, non-toxic, and provide good acoustic insulation.
</p>

<p>

    Very importantly, the CO2 footprint is very low as fungi help plants and trees absorb CO2.
</p>

<p>

    Fungus-made construction materials gradually lose water resistance and become susceptible to mold and decay. The current lifespan is about 20 years.
</p>

<p>

    Research is going to make them more durable.
</p>

<h4>

    Bamboo
</h4>

<p>

    Bamboo is a strong material with high average tensile strengths of up to 1400 psi and average compressive strength of up to 14000 psi.
</p>

<p>

    In comparison, the tensile strength of concrete is about 300 psi, and its compressive strength is about 2500 psi.
</p>

<p>

    This makes bamboo stronger than concrete.
</p>

<p>

    But concrete can easily be molded into any shape. So bamboo, a material made by nature, cannot replace concrete because of the sheer versatility of concrete.
</p>

<p>

    A comparison of their strength characteristics was made just to convey how strong bamboo can get.
</p>

<p>

    An advantage of bamboo is how we is to grow them.
</p>

<p>

    The sticks can be harvested from the tree in 3 to 5 years.
</p>

<p>

    Bamboos are used commonly to replace steel for building scaffolding.
</p>

<p>

    Bamboo can be used for building facades, partition walls, and floors. They can also used for the slabs of short bridges for foot crossing.
</p>

<p>

    But bamboos are susceptible to attacks from termites and some species of fungi. So dedicated effort is being made to find solutions to protect bamboo from termites and fungus.
</p>

<h4>

    Recycled and biodegradable materials
</h4>

<p>

    The use of recycled materials for construction is on the rise.
</p>

<p>

    Plastic materials, rubber tires, paper, concrete, steel, etc. are being recycled and reused in construction.
</p>

<p>

    The technology of material recycling is quickly developing.
</p>

<p>

    During the construction of the 2012 London Olympics, a lot of recycled materials were used, including concrete debris.
</p>

<p>

    Some of these materials like paper, rubber, and plastics can be made from biodegradable materials.
</p>

<p>

    Using biodegradable materials has the advantage of easy reuse through recycling and easy disposal without harming the environment.
</p>

<p>

    Because such materials can be reduced to non-toxic substances and discarded into the environment.
</p>

<p>

    Further examples of sustainable materials used for sustainable infrastructure include pulverized concrete, steel mill slag, steel slugs, expanded shale, styrofoams, etc.
</p>

<p>

    When choosing construction materials, infrastructure planners and builders must favor biodegradable and recyclable materials whenever possible.
</p>

<p>

    The knowledge base and application for more sustainable materials are growing rapidly through intensive research and development.
</p>

<p>

    Some of them include Hempcrete, Cork, Straw bales, Biodegradable glass, etc.
</p>

<p>

    Design engineers, construction managers, and contractors must make more efforts to patronize businesses and manufacturers who work to develop these new technologies.
</p>

<p>

    Engineers should be innovative and not afraid to try new techniques, methods, materials, and technologies in design and construction.

    Examples of novel techniques for manufacturing construction materials

<h4>

    Adoption of carbon capture techniques while manufacturing construction materials
</h4>

<p>

    Better manufacturing techniques are continually developed to replace carbon-intensive manufacturing processes.
</p>

<p>

    An example is the use of carbon capture when producing cement used in concrete.
</p>

<p>

    You can see this in the methods adopted by Biofabrik in their production of bitumen, and by Solida for their cement.
</p>

<p>

    During the manufacturing process, both companies expose their products to CO2 in a controlled environment.
</p>

<p>

    The materials absorb some of the CO2 and trap it in.
</p>

<p>

    By removing some CO2 from circulation using carbon capture techniques, the materials negate some of the quantities of CO2 emitted while manufacturing them.
</p>

<p>

    And this reduces their carbon footprint. Carbon-capturing techniques are being researched vigorously in science faculties in many higher institutions. Including the effort to trap CO2 in underwater and deep sea locations.
</p>

<h4>

    Electric arc furnaces
</h4>

<p>

    Electric arc furnace technologies are used to reduce the carbon emissions during steel production by more than 50%.
</p>

<p>

    This is because electric arc furnaces are more efficient than the blast furnaces used to heat iron and other materials during steel production.
</p>

<p>

    Civil engineering professionals can favor innovative manufacturers who incorporate sustainable methods into their manufacturing processes by patronizing them over those who use very carbon-intensive processes.
</p>

<p>

    This will help such innovative companies grow in profitability and size.
</p>

<p>

    They can then reinvest their increased income in further research and development to continually develop more sustainable methods.

<h3>

    The role of civil engineering design in energy efficiency of buildings
</h3>

<p>

    Civil engineers, designers, and builders can improve the energy efficiency of buildings by selecting eco-friendly materials.
</p>

<p>

    These materials improve the thermal performance, fire resistance, and acoustic insulation of structures.
</p>

<p>

    Examples include bamboo, hempcrete, fungi walls, and algae buildings, to name a few.
</p>

<p>

    Builders can employ the skilful application of space in buildings to control lighting, ventilation, cooling, and heating in buildings without need for electricity.
</p>

<p>

    Rainwater harvesting techniques can be installed to reduce dependence on the water grid.
</p>

<p>

    Cheap solar systems can be incorporated into buildings to generate electricity locally.
</p>

<p>

    In windy regions, builders can install small wind energy systems for the buildings.
</p>

<p>

    A combination of locally installed wind and solar systems for individual buildings can reduce the cost of transmission of electricity from the grid to such buildings.
</p>

<p>

    Skillful use of plants and plant-based materials such as algae can be used to improve ventilation and energy efficiency in buildings.
</p>

<p>

    Algae can be used to heat buildings, cultivate gardens on green buildings, and purify air.

    House in Hamburg, Germany is powered completely by algae.
</p>

<p>

    It consists of 15 apartments, with 129 louvered tanks filled with algae on two sides, and is the first building to be powered by algae alone.
</p>

<p>

    The algae on the facades keeps the building cool when it’s hot outside. It also helps to soundproof the building.
</p>

<p>

    The heat they absorb from sunlight is harvested into saline water tanks beneath the building and used later for heating.
</p>
<p>

    As the algae grow, some of it is harvested and processed into biogas in a facility within the building.
</p>

<p>

    The biogas is then used during winter to power the building.

    Through intricate design and creativity, this

        “building makes use of both solar thermal and geothermal energy… without using any fossil fuels.”
    </a>
</p>

<p>

    Green buildings such as these are known for their energy efficiency because of their low use of electricity generated by the conventional means of fossil fuels.
</p>

<p>

    More engineers should take the initiative and go beyond the convention to produce buildings with net-zero carbon emissions.
