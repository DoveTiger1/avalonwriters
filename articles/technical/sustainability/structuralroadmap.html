    <h3>

      1. Preliminary Knowledge
    </h3>
    <p>

      Many students or even graduate engineers in the field try to learn or practice structural engineering without having a solid basis in mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>

      This is a mistake which makes it difficult for them to understand, let alone master a lot of structural engineering concepts.
    </p>

    <p>

      I remember many of my fellow students during my undergraduate years complaining about how difficult structural engineering was. But I knew what their problem was. They did not know enough mathematics to succeed as engineering students.
    </p>

    <p>

      You must realize that engineering is simply the application of scientific knowledge and principles. And structural engineering is basically an application of mathematics and physics. So without proper grounding in mathematics, it will be an uphill battle for you.
    </p>

    <p>

      So, do not make the same mistake of allowing your fundamentals in mathematics to be shaky.
    </p>

    <p>

      The mathematical concepts you need to know is not that difficult to grasp. You were probably just afraid of math for no reason, didn't like your math teachers, or had bad math teachers.
    </p>

    <p>

      Whatever the issue, there is no problem.
    </p>
    <p>

      If you're weak in Math, the links below will direct you to YouTube videos and short playlists that will help you transition from someone who finds mathematical concepts difficult to someone who can use them proficiently to solve engineering problems.
    </p>

But make sure to learn it if you want to go as far as learning how to use Finite Element Analysis in structural engineering.
    </p>

    <p>

      <blockquote class="blockquote1">

        Note: Don't misunderstand the issue of mathematics here. You can totally binge watch these mathematics playlists just to understand the concepts. I'm not trying to turn you into a math wizard.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>

      After all you'll most likely never solve difficult mathematical problems by hand while on the job. There are numerous structural engineering software that do all the tough computations, and every engineering firm uses them.
    </p>

    <p>

      You simply need to understand what these software packages do and how they do it to use them proficiently.
    </p>

    <p>

      You will only need to be a math expert if you're part of a team that creates some of the commercial structural analysis and design software.
    </p>

    <p>

      So for most jobs, a simple understanding of these mathematical principles will surely make everything you get to study and do in structural engineering easy.
    </p>

    <p>

      That's why I only suggest that you binge watch these courses linked above without spending too much time on them. Your goal is to become a structural engineer.
    </p>

    <p>

    When you're done with them, you will be grounded in the mathematical concepts you need. And you can now learn structural engineering easily. You just have to build yourself up by learning the skills described the sections below.
    </p>

    <h3>

      2. Theoretical Basis of Structural Engineering
    </h3>

    <h4 class="centered underline">
      Statics
    </h4>

    <p>
      You need to understand the first principles of structural mechanics. This means you need a solid foundation on engineering statics for a start.
    </p>

    <p>


      In engineering statics, you will learn how to apply the knowledge of vectors, which you learned from physics and linear algebra, to engineering problems. You will master both 2D and 3D vector applications for forces and displacements.
    </p>

    <p>

      You will then master how to derive the centroids and moments of inertia for different shapes.
    </p>

    <p>

      You will take your knowledge further by mastering how to resolve the forces and moments acting on beams, columns, and frames using the three equations of static equilibrium.
    </p>

</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">

  Mechanics of Deformable Materials
</h4>

<p>

  You will take your knowledge of statics further by mastering the mechanics of engineering materials. Here you will deepen your understanding of what support reactions and internal responses of structural systems are.
</p>

<p>

  You will also learn how to analyze the internal responses, stresses, and strains in statically indeterminate structures.
</p>

<p>

  You will gain a solid grounding in the examination of the stresses and strains that develop in loaded structural systems due to these internal responses and then learn how to calculate the slopes and deflections of members such as beams and frames.
</p>

<p>

  You will learn how to solve for the slopes and displacements of structural members using the method of superposition, virtual work, and Castigliano's theorem.
</p>

<p>

  Furthermore, you will learn the concept of column buckling under axial compression.
</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">

  Structural Analysis
</h4>

<p>

  You will take your knowledge of engineering mechanics further by mastering how to analyze structural members using energy methods.
</p>

<p>

  You will study load take down for multi-storey structures using tributary areas and how to draw influence lines for moving loads over structures such as roofs, slabs and bridges.
</p>

<p>

  You will master the use of energy methods such as the Virtual Work Principle and Castigliano’s theorem. And learn techniques such as the 3-moment equation, the force method, moment area method, and slope deflection method.
</p>
<p>

  You will perfect your skills for drawing and interpreting shear force and bending moment diagrams and analyzing indeterminate structures.
</p>

<p>

  At this stage, you must already start trying your hands on using software to aid you in structural analysis. We will cover the software you will use in the “Software” section.

<h4 class="centered underline">

  Civil Engineering Materials
</h4>

<p>

  Though the studies on the Mechanics of Deformable Materials gave you the skills you need to understand how engineering materials perform under loading when used as structural members, this course is civil engineering specific. It will teach you useful skills you need in your repertoire as a structural engineer.
</p>

<p>

  You will learn more about concrete and the individual materials used for concrete.
</p>

<p>

  You will study aggregates and their classifications&mdash;
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>

    fine aggregates or sand, and
  </li>
  <li>

    coarse aggregates also known as gravels, stones, or chippings.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

  You will learn how to perform laboratory testing to ascertain the properties of these materials.
</p>

<p>

  You will understand material testing and grading experiments such as sieve analysis, tensile and compressive strength tests, moisture content, specific gravity, specific weight, and how to compute stresses and strains for these materials.
</p>

<p>

  You will also study their engineering behavior when used in cement concrete and asphalt concrete.
</p>

<p>

  This course explains how to mix fine and coarse aggregates and water with Portland cement or bitumen to produce cement concrete or asphalt concrete.
</p>

<p>

  Finally, you will learn about the engineering characteristics of steel and timber prior to learning how to design them as structural members.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">

  Structural Steel Design
</h4>

<p>

  Steel is one of the most important structural materials. It is ubiquitous and can be used for almost any structural application both within and beyond civil engineering.
</p>

<p>

  It is cheap, durable, and easy to mold into any shape necessary for the application it is to be used for.
</p>

<p>

  This is why a complete course is dedicated for the design of structural steel. Some structural engineering experts even specialize in the design and construction of steel structures.
</p>

<p>

  So you must take your study of the analysis, design, and applications of steel structures very seriously.
</p>

<p>

  You will master the use of steel codes and manuals of the country where you live, such as the American Institute of Steel Construction or the British Standard.
</p>

<p>

  You must also understand the material behavior of steel and the various steel sections and sizes used regularly in structural engineering. They are all described in depth in the steel manuals and code.
</p>

<p>

  Examples of some sections include the W-beams, I-beams, Channel beams, rectangular and circular sections, etc.
</p>

<p>

  You will learn the different weight to length ratios of the different sections, how, why, where, and when to choose a particular section for your design, bearing in mind the serviceability and strength limit states you need to achieve in your design.
</p>

<p>

  You must also know how to use software to speed up your analysis and design of steel structures such as beams, columns, and trusses.
</p>

<p>

  Learn the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMWYqYeZmIE&list=PLCV9OyAY5K-XqkbzRSbGvcRV5iZUoCU-o&pp=iAQB">Design of Structural Steel here</a>.
</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">

  Reinforced Concrete Design
</h4>

<p>

  Concrete and steel are two of the most used structural materials in structural engineering.
</p>

<p>

  There is hardly any structural engineer who will not know how to analyze and design concrete structures.
</p>

<p>

  So you must dedicate a lot of energy and time to master the design of concrete members such as beams, columns, slabs, and staircases. You must also learn how to analyze and design foundation members such as pads and footings.
</p>

<p>

  You must understand the material behavior of concrete and how to mix and produce concrete of any desired strength, bearing in mind the mix ratio of the Portland cement, fine and coarse aggregates, and necessary moisture content.
</p>

<p>

  You must understand the different methods of concrete production such as in situ mixing of concrete on the site of use, precast concrete, and pre-stressed concrete.
</p>

<p>

  You must understand concrete curing and testing. The compressive and tensile behavior of concrete. Why steel bar reinforcements and stirrups are used to reinforce concrete to improve its performance in tension. And the behavior of concrete under high shear forces, tensile forces, and bending.
</p>

<p>

  You must master how to use the design codes and manuals of your country and learn how to design to specification.
</p>

<p>

  You must understand how concrete fails&mdash;through creep, buckling, cracking, fatigue, etc. And how to correct and repair failing concrete members in buildings.
</p>

<p>

  Structural design is basically done after the analysis of the structure. Structural analysis provides you with the support reactions, internal responses, and deformations that result in each structural member due to applied loads and moments.
</p>

<p>

  <em><strong>Serviceability Limit State</strong></em> ensures that members do not deflect too much under loading. While <em><strong>Strength Limit State</strong></em> ensures that members can generate the internal responses to withstand the loads without failing.
</p>

<p>These two factors control the design of structural members. Statisfying them means that the structure performs without problems.</p>

<p>

  So you must understand how to apply factors of safety to satisfy these two limit states&mdash;While considering financial costs
</p>

<p>

  So, you must learn to produce safe designs at the lowest possible financial costs.
</p>

</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">

  Geotechnical engineering/soil mechanics
</h4>

<p>

  As a structural engineer, you need some fundamental understanding of foundation properties.</p>

  <p>So, you have to learn the different soil types and properties and how to calculate the allowable bearing pressure for soils. Then try to understand lateral earth and hydrostatic pressure calculations for retaining wall designs.
</p>

<p>

  For the allowable bearing pressure, pay close attention to the ultimate bearing capacity of soils and net bearing pressure.
</p>

<p>

  You need basic understanding of geotechnical and foundation and engineering. Because when you work as a structural engineer, you will most likely be responsible for the design of foundation members. And you have to understand and use test results and recommendations from geotechnical engineers to make your designs.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

  As a structural engineer, you should not spend too much time on this part. Specialized geotechnical engineers have more to worry about these topics.
</p>

<p>

  Binge watch those playlists to gain the basic knowledge you need to help you work better with geotechnical engineers.
</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">

  Summary of theoretical concepts you need to master in structural engineering
</h4>

<p>

  In summary, make sure you're well grounded in these theoretical concepts of structural engineering:
</p>

<ol class="list alphabetical">
  <li>Free body diagrams.</li>
  <li>Bending moment and shear force diagrams.</li>
  <li>Calculation of material properties such as center of gravity, moment of inertia, and polar moment of inertia.</li>
  <li>Calculation of material properties such of modulus of elasticity, section modulus, poisson's ratio, modulus of rigidity.</li>
  <li>Solving trusses using method of joints and method of sections.</li>
  <li>Beam deflection and the flexure formula for bending in beams.</li>
  <li> The different types of loads, their meaning and applications. Examples include wind loads, live loads, dead loads, earthquake loads, snow loads, rain loads. Tributary area for each member so you can really perform load take down properly.</li>
  <li>Design of common steel members like rafters, beams, columns, struts, and bracings. The design of cold formed steel like purlins and girders.</li>
  <li>Design of reinforced concrete beams, slabs, columns, and walls. Design of prestressed concrete.</li>
  <li>Some basics of soil mechanics and foundation engineering.</li>
</ol>

<h3>

  3. Software for Structural Engineering
</h3>
<h4 class="centered underline">

  AutoCAD for drawing and detailing
</h4>

<p>

  It is difficult to come across any real structural engineer who does not use AutoCAD.
</p>

<p>

  This ubiquitous software is the trademark of Autodesk software company and serves almost all purposes for the drafting of buildings and production of 2D plans to be used in construction sites by contractors and for presentation to clients.
</p>

<p>

  Any new engineering student must start from the get go to learn and practice how to draw buildings and site plans using AutoCAD. And you must continuously practice and develop your skills in AutoCAD.
</p>

<p>

  Structural engineers are not architects though, so you're not required to master the artistic and aesthetic design of buildings.
</p>

<p>

  But you're expected to know how to export design specifications from structural analysis and design software such as ETABS, SAP, Tekla etc.
</p>

<p>

  And how to import them into AutoCAD to produce your finished structural detailing and site specification drawings. These are the drawings used by construction site workers, managers and contractors.
</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">
  Structural Analysis and Design Software
</h4>

<p>

  You must know how to use software packages for structural analysis and design. It is not an opt-in situation for any structural engineer&mdash;You must use structural analysis and design software on the job.
</p>

<p>

  Sometimes, some small construction projects are simple enough that all members necessary for the buildings have been used so many times, everywhere.
</p>

<p>

  Engineers already know all the material behavior and responses for a 12 feet by 12 feet room in a small residential home, for instance.
</p>

<p>

  Sometimes, in cases like these, no structural design is even done. They already know all the members to use and how to make and install them.
</p>

<p>

  But beyond these kinds of simple projects, most engineering projects are very complicated and will take ages to be analysed and designed by hand calculations.
</p>

<p>

  Some are even so complicated that hand calculations are nearly impossible.
</p>

<p>

  So every structural engineer most know how to analyze and design structural members using various software.
</p>

<p>

  You must learn how to use software such as ETABS, Prota, Tekla, Ansys, Abaqus, etc.
</p>

<p>

  Like we discussed before, it is important that you have the mathematical grounding and the thorough understanding of structural engineering concepts to understand what these software are doing.
</p>

<p>

  A car is useless to someone who cannot drive. Furthermore, if your phone crashes to the ground, burns, or falls into liquid and refuses to turn on, a phone technician who cannot diagnose your phone's issues is useless to you. Right?
</p>

<p>

So is it with you as a structural engineer and these analysis and design software.
</p>

<p>

  If you don't understand what you want to analyze or design, no matter how powerful Ansys, Abaqus, Catia, or Prota may be, they will be useless to you and you will be useless with them.
</p>

<p>

  You must have a solid theoretical basis in structural engineering. Then you can go ahead to seek mastery in one or two of these software. You cannot learn all. Just master how to use one or two and you will be able to switch from one to the other with little effort.
</p>

<p>

  Most of these software have simple workflow with intuitive interfaces and good documentations.
</p>

<p>

  Once you learn how to create the geometry and shapes of the structural members you want to design, you will learn how to add section and material properties, and how add support conditions and specifications such as moment releases (hinges).
</p>

<p>

  You will then learn how to add different types of loading conditions that suit your analysis or design purposes.
</p>

<p>

  You must then know how to generate and export your reports from the analysis and design results.
</p>

<p>

  And viola, you've learned how to use these kinds of software. And you can easily switch between different software packages depending on what your firm needs.
</p>

<p>

  So basically the needs and preferences of your firm, colleagues, or clients will mostly determine the software you use because each software has its strengths and weaknesses.
</p>

<p>

  ETABS, for instance, is very good for the design of reinforced concrete, but Tekla may be better in steel design, while SAP2000 may be better for large structures such as dams.
</p>

<p>

  Once you get a hang of structural analysis and design, ensure you start trying your hands with the different available software.</p> <p>But ensure to master at least one. Learn how to use it from start to finish for complete structural analysis.
</p>

<p>

  From creating the geometry to reporting and exporting results. This will serve you well in the long run.
</p>

<p>

  Depending on your region, you can also check out the following software packages: Space Gass, STRIAN, RAM Concept, Skyciv, RAPT, MASTAN2, and Revit.
</p>

<p>

  You cannot learn all of them because there are so many. So, just look to learn and master the few industry standards in your region.
</p>

<p>

  And when you get a job, as long as you're already capable with some software packages, you can quickly pick up the exact software stack used by your firm.
</p>

<p>

  CAD is CAD regardless of the software you are using.
</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">
  Finite Element Analysis
</h4>

<p>

  Finite element analysis is not a software but a technique. But I decided to include it under this section for two reasons&mdash;
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>

    you do not have to master finite element analysis to work as a structural engineer, so I didn't include it in the core theoretical section
  </li>
  <li>

    and you cannot perform FEA on a structure without using software.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

  So this should be part of the last skills you acquire as a structural engineer as it is not compulsory for getting your feet into the job market.
</p>

<p>

  But you would want to learn and master FEA if you want to be a structural engineer of reckoning.
</p>

  Almost all the powerful structural analysis and design software perform Finite Element Analysis under the hood. Mastering this skill helps you understand what they're doing, their strengths and weaknesses.
</p>

<p>

  The finite element method is roughly based on the spring equation <em><strong>F = kx</strong></em>.
</p>

<p>
where
  <blockquote class="blockquote1">
    <em><strong>F</strong></em> represents the external force system acting on the structure,
    <em><strong>k</strong></em> is the spring constant, and
    <em><strong>x</strong></em> represents the displacement
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  The Finite Element Analysis software computes the Force vectors, and constructs the stiffness matrix. To solve for the displacements, the inverse of the stiffness matrix is used to multiply the force vectors to obtain the displacement vector.
</p>

<p>

  Using the values of displacements, the internal forces and responses in each member of the structure, including moments, stresses, and strains are computed.
</p>

<p>

  The finite element method helps engineers move away from the struggle to solve for unknown forces in indeterminate structures. You rather solve for displacements using the stiffness matrix which is easy for structural engineering analysis and design software to compute.
</p>

<p>

  To really gain thorough understanding of finite element methods, you need to understand differential equations, so your knowledge of mathematics comes in handy again here.
</p>

<p>

  Mastering how to use finite element methods for solving complicated problems in structural engineering will really put you ahead of most engineers.

  4. Practical Knowledge
</h3>

<h4 class="centered underline">
  Structural drawings
</h4>

<p>

  All the calculations, analysis, and design we perform as engineers must and can only be presented to the contractors and clients through structural drawings.
</p>

<p>

  Without these drawings, the builders will not understand any work you perform as the structural engineer. So structural drawings are the manuals that guide and direct every work done on construction sites.
</p>

<p>

  You must learn how to read structural drawings prepared by other engineers and how to prepare your own. It is absolutely impossible to work in the field of structural engineering without these skills.
</p>

<p>

  Software such as AutoCAD and Revit are your go to software for preparing structural drawings.
</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">
  Construction terminology
</h4>

<p>

  You should learn the names used to refer to construction materials and activities.
</p>

<p>

  Understand and commit many building components to your memory.
</p>

<p>

  In steel construction for example, you should try to know what the following components refer to: rafters, struts, bracings, flats, outriggers, purlins, plates, fin-plates, cap-plates, stiffeners, T-cleats, fillet welds, bolt sizes, butt welds, etc.
</p>

<p>

  As a new graduate engineer in the field, it can be overwhelming to really learn all these different terminologies for the first time. And it's easy to get confused when construction terminologies you do not understand are used constantly by your colleagues.
</p>

<p>

  To catch up quickly, research annotated diagrams for steel, timber, and concrete construction in google. Then try to commit as much as you can to your memory.
</p>

<p>

  Also visit construction sites and try to identify as many components as you can. Gradually, it will become second nature to.
</p>

<h3>

  5. Experience
</h3>
<h4 class="centered underline">
  Internships
</h4>

<p>

Apply for internships in small companies and consolidate what you're learning through practical application.
</p>

<p>

  Even if you're still in your first year at the university, internships will be incredibly beneficial to you. It will speed up your process of learning and maturity as a future structural engineer.
</p>

<p>

  And please, always choose internships in small firms over larger firms. The larger firms are big names of course and command respect. But structural engineering is a skill intensive profession. No one cares where you got your experiences as long as you have sufficient skills to do the job.
</p>

<p>

  In small firms, you'll receive higher attention, and superior mentorship from the senior and resident engineers than in the bigger firms. You might also be given more challenging and hands on tasks in smaller companies. So I advise that you prioritize learning over attaching weighty names to your resume.
</p>

<p>

  At this stage of your career, skills are more important.
</p>

<p>

  There is a better way for creating a solid resume. You can look out for my upcoming articles on how to create an outstanding structural engineering resume and how to build a structural engineering portfolio that will land you your dream job.

</p>

<p>

  The experience you get from internships will make you more efficient when you start working as a graduate engineer because you already have a few years of field experience under your belt.
</p>

<h4 class="centered underline">
  Personal projects
</h4>

<p>

  To consolidate your knowledge, try to design different types of structures. Perform every engineering calculation process step by step. And produce a real, working, safe, and cost effective design with usable and industry standard structural drawings and specifications.
</p>

<p>

  This will really help you improve quickly as a structural engineer. Producing many of these personal projects will grow your skill sets. You will develop superior quality, proficiency, and self-reliance as an engineer.
</p>

<p>

  It will also help you during job applications because you can compile them into your <em><strong>personal structural engineering portfolio</strong></em> and present them when applying for jobs.
</p>

<p>

  As an example, for steel design, you can sketch up a little warehouse and pick up a virtual construction site for it in your local industrial area.
</p>

<p>

  If possible, you can get the soil specifications from the government agency or labs in the area. Since you're doing it study purposes, they may be willing to give you some of the specifications for free.
</p>

<p>

  You can then carry out the entire design process and generate every single calculation and structural drawing necessary to build the warehouse.
</p>

<p>

  Make sure to perform all the steps accurately as if it were a real project.
</p>

<p>

  Research everything you need to know along the way as you work on the project. And when you need help, reach out to professionals or university professors.
</p>

<p>

  If can take your time and do many of these projects well, you might find out that you learn a lot more doing them than in all your undergraduate and graduate classes combined.
</p>
<hr>

<p>

  There you go.
</p>

<p>

  You have learned the intensive and complete five-step process to study, learn, and master the skills you need to work as a structural engineer in a record time.
</p>

<p>

  Apply yourself in these steps, with diligence and consistency, and in no time, you may find yourself handling important engineering responsibilities and tasks for real life, professional structural engineering firms, and being paid handsomely for it.
