          So read on. I've got something to tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are at the peak of civilization. With Artificial Intelligence
            everywhere, maybe Alex Proyas' movie

          <em><strong>I, Robot</strong></em>
         could soon become a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I don't think so. Because I don't believe AI
            could ever have such capabilities.

            But the technological advancements of today seem unstoppable. Only
            a doomsday apocalypse on a global scale could stop the current
            technological explosion.
        Or a war between the US and Russia which will certainly be kind of
            apocalyptic.

        </p>
        <p>
          We live in a very unique time in history.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's never been &ldquo;as possible as it is now &rdquo; for
            people to raise themselves from rags to riches, or at least to the
            upper middle class.

        </p>
        <p>
          Mark you, I said
          &ldquo;as possible as it is now&rdquo;, not
          &ldquo;as easy &rdquo;
          . Because nothing worthwhile is ever easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current boom in technology and easy availability of information
            presents us with incredible economic opportunities as never seen
            before.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the
          benevolent culprit to thank for the grand scale of the economic
            possibilities available today is technological advancement.

          These lyrical bars from Jay Z in his rap song

          We live in peculiar times when opportunities abound everywhere but
            nobody wants to work anymore. Everyone wants to game the
            system.
        </p>
        <p>
          People will rather spend all their time researching how to earn two
            dollars a day from an app, how to make money by clicking on emojis
            and taking selfies, and things like that, than try to do something
            productive.

        </p>
        <p>
          Productive in the sense of earning money in a manner that helps the
            economy. Right? No one wants to do things that help the economy grow
            anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all want to post selfies on Pinterest and make viral shorts on
            TikTok. So we can rake in views and smile to the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, that is possible. But how many try and fail? Numerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          But think of the numerous open job positions worldwide, and yet the
            countless number of unemployed people.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does that tell you?
        </p>
        <p>
In the US alone, there are currently more open positions, (ten million), than unemployed people,
          (five million).
          According to the
            <a
              href=" https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/more-job-openings-than-unemployed-people-since-may-2021.htm#:~:text=There%20were%2010.8%20million%20job,or%20lower%20since%20May%202021"
            >
              National bureau of employment.
            </a>

        </p>
        <p>
But why should people be unemployed in a country like the US when
            the unfilled positions outnumber the unemployed people?
        </p>
        <p>
          It's easy. Skills. Or better said, lack of skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are not enough skilled people to fill those positions. Many
            companies find it difficult to get skilled workers to fill their
            open positions.
        </p>
        <p>
Many high-skill job openings advertised online receive few or no
            applications.

        </p>
        <p>
And some that even receive numerous applications remain unfilled even
            after a long time.&mdash;
        </p>
        <p>
Because most of those applicants are neither skilled enough nor the
            right fit for the positions they applied for.
        </p>
        <p>
And while numerous unemployed or underemployed people walk around
            complaining about their ill luck in the labor market, only a few of
            them are willing to learn anything new. They usually prefer to
            remain unemployed than to learn a new skill.
        </p>
        <p>
By being here, I assume you can be convinced to stop acting like
            the crowd who seem to dislike investing their time and effort toward
            learning anything.

        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you would love to be like those few people who value
            continuous learning. The few that realize that the biggest
            investment they can make is to continuously learn new things and
            develop themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it's time for you to start learning new skills. Because
            if you do, you will hardly go unemployed again.</
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I'm going to try and avoid hitting you with another
            clich&eacute; by asking you to learn programming and IT skills
            because the jobs are too many and pay so well.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've probably heard that it is difficult to learn
            programming well enough to be good enough for commercial software
            development.

        </p>
        <p>
          Well, it's true.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start from zero and get to the stage where a global machine like
            a company or business will trust you with their code base, and
            expect you to tinker out programs that solve internal problems for
            them and/or serve their customers'needs, is a tall
            order.
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes a lot of time. You will have sleepless and frustrating
            nights of seemingly no progress. And you will need incredible
            persistence, and some stroke of good luck to pull it off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software development pays extremely well, but it's not
            easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not to discourage you from a thrill-filled, interesting,
            and dynamic industry with massive importance and role for the global
            economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can take a crack at software development. Have patience, stick
            with it, and be in the learning zone for the long haul. And you will
            certainly smile at it later.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some industries pay equally well and have lots of opportunities
            for career development and progression which also lack skilled
            workers.
        </p>

          Such industries are not less important and are not even decoupled
            from IT.

        </p>
        <p>
          No industry today is decoupled from IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          And rising to executive positions in such industries does not
            require less skill and hard work, and does not have a lower learning
            curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          No. They rather have a somewhat lower barrier of entry. You can
            learn a little, get a job, and start getting paid quickly. Much
            faster than in the IT industry or for IT positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the potential for career progression is not lower than you have
            for IT positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you're in a job, you can continue to learn, develop
            yourself, and rise, until you get to the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          And one of such
          simpler
          &nbsp;industries with lots of open positions is the supply chain
            industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The barrier of entry for a skilled supply chain job is not that
            low, but with some effort, it is very doable, even without a
            university degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          And very importantly, there are plenty of openings looking for
            people like you to fill them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can do the job and deliver the results, you are needed and
            welcomed even if you studied library science.</span

        </p>
        <p>
          So, just as for many IT positions where it does't matter
            what you studied, so is it here.

        </p>
        <p>
          But the good thing about the supply chain for you is that it has a
            faster learning curve from total novice to getting your feet into
            the job industry than programming and IT.

        </p>
        <p>
          The jobs also offer better work-life balance than the high-pressure
            and deadline-filled IT jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I can show you how to go about learning enough about the supply
            chain to get a job easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll wrap it up here with the belief that you should be
            interested in knowing more.
