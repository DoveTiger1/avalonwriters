        <h2>Why computer games could be good for your kids</h2>
        <h4>by Chukwuma Chibuike</h4>

        <p>
          Throughout the ages, humankind has always been curious. And this
          curiosity coupled with necessity forced the development of tools to
          aid in work and production. Science and technology were thereby
          developed with an emphasis on utility — to make work and life easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          But through various stages of advancement, modern technology appeared
          in the scene with a rapid explosion. And all of a sudden, utility was
          no longer the motive behind all work. Even entertainment, fun, and
          leisure now receive considerable investment in human resources and
          skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Video games as a form of entertainment are a product of this
          modernity. But one may rightly argue that the value of these games
          goes beyond entertainment and that they are anything but harmful as
          some very conservative people wrongly believe. In fact, video games
          are useful to children in many ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, let's quickly do away with the idea that video games are
          harmful. Video game addicts do not prove anything here at all. Most of
          them are simply good people who need a little help.
        </p>

        <p>
          And people have been, and many still remain addicted to food, alcohol,
          smoking, sex, pornography, masturbation, gambling, partying, and the
          nightlife, watching movies, TV series, or shows of all kinds, to name
          many.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smoking, and belief systems aside, someone's excessive attachment to
          any of the activities listed above does not make those activities
          inherently bad in themselves; although, one with a moralistic tendency
          would also add pornography and masturbation to their book of
          inherently bad activities. And we fully acknowledge their rights to do
          so even if we are not here to preach morality.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, for an addict, what's bad is the person's predilection towards
          something, resulting from weakness of will and character. And having
          personally struggled with addictions myself, I believe I can attest to
          this fact.
        </p>

        <p>
          Granted, there are violent and bad video games just as there are
          violent and bad movies. But just as parents can show discretion and
          care to control the movies their kids watch, they should also be able
          to do so with the games they allow their kids to play.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is well known that some excessive gamers lose out on healthy social
          or even professional lives due to excessive gaming, but anything in
          life will always have those who exaggerate it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore if we declare people to be addicted when they are incapable
          of abstaining from a particular kind of activity, even for a while, to
          the extent that it causes harmful effects on other aspects of their
          lives, then it can be argued correctly that a workaholic who ends up
          losing his marriage due to his overly attachment to his job can also
          be described as being addicted to his job, regardless of his
          professional successes.
        </p>

        <p>
          After all, he lost a family because he overly prioritized his
          profession and was unable to find a good work-life balance. Even
          though society would hardly frown at him, it could never really count
          as a good thing for him.
        </p>

        <p>
          So the point being made here is simply that people lose their heads
          and therefore their balance in life over many different kinds of
          things, even seemingly good stuff, like a job! So, it's not just about
          bad activities or even the normally harmless video games which is the
          least of society's worries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, having debunked the myth that video games might be harmful, let's
          come to some of the numerous benefits of playing video games.
        </p>

            <h3>Better brains and improved hand-eye coordination</h3>
            <p></p>

            <p>
              Fast-paced games require quick reaction times. Therefore, those
              who play such games often develop much better coordination skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Their hands and fingers act generally faster in response to an
              impulse or wish.
            </p>

            <p>
              They learn to think critically using different parts of their
              brains, make quick split-second decisions, apply the decisions
              immediately without much pondering, and see the results in an
              instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              This carries over into other domains of activities where gamers
              have been identified to react to questions and situations up to
              25% faster than non-gamers

          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Improved feelings and emotional health</h3>
            <p>
              While playing video games, gamers experience a positive adrenaline
              rush, a greater flow of dopamine, and feel-good hormones in the
              brain, the nervous system, and the entire body in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gaming has even been touted as therapeutic, giving people greater
              confidence, energy, and emotional positivity, and reducing stress,
              depression, and anxiety
              <a

          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>They can also be educational</h3>
            <p>
              There are many educational video games out there that are as
              interesting as the seemingly non-educational ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              And some of these help students learn using audio-visual aids, in
              a more hands-on and involved manner, guiding them through
              interesting adventures that improve their concentration and focus,
              and helping them to understand and absorb content much better
              through the concrete applications available in such games.
            </p>

            <p>
              By playing these games, students could develop new skills and
              understand schoolwork better by putting different parts of their
              brains to work. And this could possibly lead to improved
              performance and scores in school.

            <h3>
              Games help children make friends and improve their social lives
            </h3>

            <p>
              Video games help kids in social settings by giving them what to
              talk about among their peers. They help defuse tension and awkward
              situations among new friends, giving them common ground.
            </p>

            <p>
              Being good in a game could make a kid look cool and acceptable
              among friends in the right way.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many times, when acquaintances and friends meet together, they
              play games to keep things interesting. People even set out and
              meet each other for the first time solely for the purpose of
              playing games.
            </p>

            <p>
              Playing games could help improve the social lives of kids through
              meeting new people both in person and online
              <a href="https://atonce.com/blog/benefits-of-playing-video-games"
                >[2]</a
              >. And create the opportunity to forge lasting and meaningful
              friendships and relationships.
            </p>

            <p>
              Multiplayer games teach kids teamwork, cooperation, and effective
              communication which carry through from social settings into their
              adulthood and even professional lives.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Games could help parents teach kids discipline</h3>

            <p>
              Parents can control the games their kids play and the amount of
              time kids spend playing them. In fact, games could be used to
              teach kids responsibility, accountability, and discipline.
            </p>

            <p>
              Kids can be encouraged to work hard by using very entertaining
              games as a reward for jobs well done and by withholding access
              when they fail to meet expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, by setting a limit on how much time kids spend on the games
              they love, kids learn that sometimes, they have to work on their
              studies or do chores and other activities that they may not gladly
              subscribe to, such as tidying up and going to bed early, or
              attending family social gatherings, going to the church or to the
              dentist.
            </p>

            <p>Because not every time should be fun time.</p>
            <p>
              So, having access to what they enjoy and leaving it behind to
              perform not-so-fun but necessary activities is a tool for
              instilling discipline in kids at an early age.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

          Many positive results can be achieved by using video games in
          different ways and for different purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one underlying experience remains among all regular players of the
          various games out there. Regardless of the intent or purpose, whether
          to kill time, fight boredom, or entertain oneself, video games are
          very fun to play. They are enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all one needs is to find what one enjoys, and in an instant, it is
          very easy to make oneself happy, alone, or in groups, while enjoying
          many side benefits.
        </p>
        <p>Even adults should play. The benefits are for everyone!</p>
