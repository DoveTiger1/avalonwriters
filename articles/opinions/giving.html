        <h2>Why I could give</h2>

        <p>I could give freely because I <em>could</em> pursue my goals.</p>

        <p>
          I believed I had nothing to compete for, but simply had goals to
          achieve.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had personal goals to work for. And there was the possibility of
          achieving them.
        </p>

        <p>
          To me, life was never a competition with anyone because everyone and
          anyone could strive for his highest good. Or so I thought.
        </p>
        <p>This was how I saw life...</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>
          Men find happiness first in the pursuit of personal goals, not just in
          the complete achievement of their goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just the simple, correct, and proven belief that they
          <em>can</em> pursue their goals already makes them happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          That real possibility of future achievement if they actually decided
          to work hard, that hope, true hope, already brings satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when a man believes he is <em>allowed</em> to pursue his personal
          goals, freely and unrestrained, even prior to self-actualization and
          fulfillment, he has this urge and tendency to mentor, help, and uplift
          others.
        </p>

        <p><strong>And this was why I could give...</strong></p>

        <p>...</p>

        <ul class="points-list">
          <li>
            üèà A man does not need to have achieved self-fulfillment to give,
            mentor, and uplift.
          </li>
          <li>
            üèà He just needs to have that assurance that he can also pursue his
            own goals. The simple assurance which gives him the hope of a future
            fulfillment. Of a future actualization...
          </li>
          <li>üèà ...if only he tried</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And it is this hope that makes giving to, mentoring, and uplifting
          others nothing to him. Just something he does like second nature
          without forethought. A natural part of life and living...
        </p>
        <p>...</p>

        <p>
          But when a man feels intentionally stifled by external circumstances,
          all kinds of emotions develop. The bickering, anger, counting costs,
          comparisons, and possibly jealousy, envy, hate, vengeance, and
          cruelty.
        </p>

        <p>
          So the secret to happy people who <em>‚Äúrise by lifting others‚Äù</em> is
          simply that they themselves are convinced that they are working
          towards their own ascent, in a self-directed manner. And not in ways
          dictated by others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond this, there are slaves, or paid-for-hire workers (killers) who
          have no single personal inner feelings in what they do.
          <br />
          Their deeds are not borne of conviction.
          <br />For the slaves, it's a matter of can't help, and for the
          lansquenets, it's simply for the rewards.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lansquenet will often ask "What's in it for me?" And as long as
          his weird calculations and simulations are satisfied, he can go to
          great lengths to pursue courses he does not believe in - <br />- On
          behalf of others.
        </p>

        <p>
          But people who wear their hearts on their sleeves, who can't pretend,
          can only work if they believe their own needs are satisfied. And this
          has nothing to do with the "what's in it for me?" of a lansquenet.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's rather the simple understanding that to contribute freely to the
          growth of others, one also has to feel, concretely and correctly, that
          one is allowed to grow too‚Ä¶ if one wants to.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one can build those who stifle him. There is never true happiness
          in that. And demanding it from anyone is tantamount to injustice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The man who can pursue his goals freely will gladly help other
          wayfarers he meets along the way when he has to walk with them, i.e.,
          when they are a part of his journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em> And this is how competition is eliminated. - </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          ¬∑ From the onset, it can never even develop. Unless two or more
          persons are vying for the same spot. Like we have in politics,
          business, or corporate organizations.
        </p>

        <p>‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>
          So I did not need to have reached my destination before helping others
          on their way to theirs.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Maslow's</strong> theory about a man having to achieve
          self-actualization before his choices and actions are dictated by
          <em>transcendence</em> (mentoring others) may not be entirely true.
        </p>

        <p>
          One who simply believes he can work towards his own goals is already
          capable of being motivated by Maslow's <em>transcendence</em> in his
          decision-making and actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would gladly help others to the best of my ability even before
          achieving my own goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          As long as I do not feel stifled; as long as I am living my own life
          and not someone else's idea of what my life should be for him.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, I only just wished and still wish that my own life could unfold in
          a direction of my choosing. <br />For I sincerely do not want to live
          someone else's life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such pressure only creates unexpected emotions. Polluting the hitherto
          clean air with foul odor.
