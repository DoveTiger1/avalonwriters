      Why I could give   I could give freely because I could pursue my goals.  
      I believed I had nothing to compete for, but simply had goals to achieve.
        I had personal goals to work for. And there was the possibility of
      achieving them.   To me, life was never a competition with anyone because
      everyone and anyone could strive for his highest good. Or so I thought.  
      This was how I saw life...   ...   Men find happiness first in the pursuit
      of personal goals, not just in the complete achievement of their goals.  
      Just the simple, correct, and proven belief that they can pursue their
      goals already makes them happy.   That real possibility of future
      achievement if they actually decided to work hard, that hope, true hope,
      already brings satisfaction.   And when a man believes he is allowed to
      pursue his personal goals, freely and unrestrained, even prior to
      self-actualization and fulfillment, he has this urge and tendency to
      mentor, help, and uplift others.   And this was why I could give...   ...
        A man does not need to have achieved self-fulfillment to
      give, mentor, and uplift.   He just needs to have that assurance that he
      can also pursue his own goals. The simple assurance which gives him the
      hope of a future fulfillment. Of a future actualization...   …If only he
      tried.   And it is this hope that makes giving to, mentoring, and
      uplifting others nothing to him. Just something he does like second nature
      without forethought. A natural part of life and living...   ...   But when
      a man feels intentionally stifled by external circumstances, all kinds of
      emotions develop. The bickering, anger, counting costs, comparisons, and
      possibly jealousy, envy, hate, vengeance, and cruelty.   So the secret to
      happy people who “rise by lifting others”  is simply that they themselves
      are convinced that they are working towards their own ascent, in a
      self-directed manner. And not in ways dictated by others.   Beyond this,
      there are slaves, or paid-for-hire workers (killers) who have no single
      personal inner feelings in what they do.   Their deeds are not borne of
      conviction. Rather, for the slaves, it’s a matter of can't help, and for
      the lansquenets, it’s simply for the rewards.   The lansquenet will often
      ask "What's in it for me?" And as long as his weird calculations and
      simulations are satisfied, he can go to great lengths to pursue courses he
      does not believe in - On behalf of others.   But people who wear their
      hearts on their sleeves, who can't pretend, can only work if they believe
      their own needs are satisfied. But this has nothing to do with the "what's
      in it for me?" of a lansquenet.   It’s rather the simple understanding
      that to contribute freely to the growth of others, one also has to feel,
      concretely and correctly, that one is allowed to grow too… if one wants
      to.   No one can build those who stifle him. There is never true happiness
      in that. And demanding it from anyone is tantamount to injustice.   The
      man who can pursue his goals freely will gladly help other wayfarers he
      meets along the way when he has to walk with them, i.e., when they are a
      part of his journey.   And this is how competition is eliminated. -  
      · From the onset, it can never even develop. Unless two or more persons
      are vying for the same spot. Like we have in politics, business, or
      corporate organizations.  …   So I did not need to have reached my
      destination before helping others on their way to theirs.   Maslow's
      theory about a man having to achieve self-actualization before his choices
      and actions are dictated by transcendence (mentoring others) may not be
      entirely true.   One who simply believes he can work towards his own goals
      is already capable of being motivated by Maslow’s transcendence in his
      decision-making and actions.   I would gladly help others to the best of
      my ability even before achieving my own goals.   As long as I do not feel
      stifled; as long as I am living my own life and not someone else's idea of
      what my life should be for him.   So, I only just wished and still wish
      that my own life could unfold in a direction of my choosing. For I
      sincerely do not want to live someone else's life.   Such pressure only
      creates unexpected emotions. Polluting the hitherto clean air with foul
      odor.
