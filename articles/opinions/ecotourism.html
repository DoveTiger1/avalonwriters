        <h2>Why More People Should Engage In Ecotourism</h2>

        <div class="big">
          <big
            >"ecotourism is just what the world needs to create the much-needed
            genuine personal appreciation of nature in people"</big
          >
        </div>

        <p>
          If you had to guess what most people would choose if they were asked
          to choose between:
          <br /><br />strolling for sight-seeing across streets with great
          buildings as you would find in Dubai or Paris, <br />
          <br />
          or strolling across landscapes of unadulterated natural beauty such as
          mountains or virgin forests,
          <br /><br />what would you guess?
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, like you might have guessed, probably from your own choice, most
          people would claim they'd love to go to the natural places in order to
          get close to nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          They'd want to see the Grand Canyon, the Yellowstone, the Amazon, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if a real opportunity arises to go on vacation, those wishes are
          instantly thrown behind the bus and they're off to Dubai, London,
          Paris, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          They'd suddenly want to see the Big Apple. Well, there's only one New
          York, you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all claim we love nature, want to conserve it, and want to get
          close to it and understand it.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it's mostly lip service. Many people have very little knowledge
          about the earth's geography outside the localities where they work and
          live.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most get stuck in the concepts they drew from high school geography
          which were mostly immature and incomplete then and which continue to
          get more muddled as they grow older.
        </p>

        <p>
          With such ephemeral conceptions of the geographical features of our
          home planet, it's not difficult to imagine that there's even greater
          ignorance about the natural treasures of the earth, the beautiful and
          exotic resorts of nature, and the endangered habitats with their
          unique plant and animal species.
        </p>

        <p>
          The average American for instance has hardly even visited many of the
          protected natural sites and geographical treasures within the US, let
          alone those outside the US.
        </p>

        <p>
          OnePoll and Zipcar conducted research that revealed that a quarter of
          Americans had never visited famous US landmarks [1].
        </p>

        <p>
          The research as reported by Matt Hilburn reveals that 8.2 out of 10
          Americans had never been to the Grand Canyon and 7.7 out 10 had never
          been to the Niagara Falls.
        </p>

        <p>Many had never even visited the landmarks in their own cities.</p>

        <p>
          Yet most of the research participants claimed they would love to go
          out more, to visit both the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, and
          Yellowstone National Park.
          <br />But blamed economic difficulties and stringent workplace
          conditions as their main obstructions
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet they never seized to spend a lot of money in new restaurants and
          coffee shops on a regular basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            But ecotourism is just what the world needs to create the
            much-needed genuine personal appreciation of nature in people.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it would enable the pressing need for the conservation of
          nature to truly become a personal belief and not something people
          accept because it is constantly being ripped off by news reporters.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are used to feasting our eyes on the environmentally unfriendly,
          “marvelous” constructions in large metropolitan areas. But a few
          people have also witnessed just how beautiful this earth can be
          without these constructions.
        </p>

        <p>
          And they are usually the ones whose calls for the conservation of
          nature are genuine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through firsthand experiences, they understand that this earth which
          offers nearly eight billion of us a home can produce extraordinary
          beauty and deserves real protection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jean Holy Smithereens, for instance, described an experience during a
          visit to the Grand Canyon as “one of those moments that [she] saw with
          [her] own eyes that <em>Nature</em> is still the best architect ever”
          [2].
        </p>

        <p>
          Many movements and organizations, both governmental and
          non-governmental, work towards the conservation of the earth's natural
          treasure sites and endangered habitats.
        </p>

        <p>
          And many of these habitats are some of the most beautiful places to
          ever behold.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a 2017 article on their website, CNN lists about 50 natural wonders
          of the earth worth visiting [3].
        </p>

        <p>
          Visiting these natural wonders could awaken some form of earth
          conservation consciousness in tourists.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could make them voluntarily participate in and support the
          activities of nature conservation organizations through public
          activism and patronage by donations and contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many nature resorts go a long way to protect their environments while
          making them attractive to tourists by offering leisure, beautiful
          accommodation, good food and stable electricity for tourists.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of these resorts offer five-star hospitality services for those
          looking to have the time of their lives. But they need patronage from
          more tourists to maintain and fund their businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          An example is the Sense Resort Khao Kho, a five-star hospitality
          resort located in one of Thailand's mountainous marvels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their five-star services combined with the glorious display of the
          surrounding nature's beauty would generate euphoria and ecstasy in the
          hearts of even the most skeptical tourists [4].
        </p>
        <p>
          Around most natural resorts and conservation sites in rural areas,
          many educational and community-building activities promote the growth
          of the surrounding local communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          The influx of cash tourists bring will help such local communities
          grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tourists on the other hand could gain exposure to new cultures,
          languages, and art. They could also enjoy exotic delicacies native to
          those regions in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coupled with the natural attractions and landscapes in those places.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tourists get to meet new and different people and could possibly build
          friendships that may last a lifetime.
        </p>

        <p>
          One such example is the Feel Free Center in Gambia, based in Jinack
          Niji, a coastal village in the Gambia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aside from offering hospitality services to tourists, they also
          “partner closely with community leaders and villagers ... to develop
          sustainable environmental conservation and ecotourism projects” [5].
        </p>

        <p>
          Among many things, they are involved in various health initiatives and
          aid programs and work to promote education and skills acquisition
          among girls.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, it is essential to awaken the consciousness and love of nature in
          people. And one of the best ways to achieve this is to encourage
          people to patronize natural resorts and tourist attractions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Promoting ecotourism among the populace will engender positive
          educational and holistic effects on the tourists themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          They would naturally adopt a protective stance towards the earth
          itself, based on their own lofty experiences and close contact with
          nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Greater ecotourism will also boost the economy of local and rural
          regions that offer natural attractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the indigenes of these rural areas will grow through exposure to
          visitors from different parts of the world.
