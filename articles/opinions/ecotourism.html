        <h2>Why More People Should Engage In Ecotourism</h2>
        <p>
          If you had to guess what choice most people would make if they were
          asked to choose between strolling for sight-seeing across streets with
          exquisite buildings as you would find in Dubai, Paris, London, etc.,
          or strolling across landscapes of unadulterated natural beauty such as
          lakes, beaches, mountains, virgin forests, etc., what would be your
          answer?
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, here’s the truth. Like you guessed, probably from your own
          choice, most people would claim they’d love to go to the natural
          places in order to get close to nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          They'd want to see the Grand Canyon, the Yellowstone, the Amazon, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if a real opportunity arises to go on vacation, those wishes are
          instantly thrown behind the bus and they’re off to Dubai, London,
          Paris, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          They suddenly want to see the Big Apple. Well, there’s only one New
          York, you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all claim we love nature, want to conserve it, and want to get
          close to it and understand it.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it’s mostly lip service. It’s been observed that many people have
          very little knowledge about the earth’s geography outside the
          localities where they work and live.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most get stuck in the concepts they drew from high school geography
          which were mostly immature and incomplete then and which continue to
          get more muddled as they grow older.
        </p>

        <p>
          With such ephemeral conceptions of the geographical features of our
          home planet, it’s not difficult to imagine that there’s even greater
          ignorance about the natural treasures of the earth, the exquisite and
          exotic resorts of nature, and the endangered habitats with their
          unique plant and animal species.
        </p>

        <p>
          Worse still, the average American for instance has hardly even visited
          many of the protected natural sites and geographical treasures within
          the US, let alone those outside the US.
        </p>

        <p>
          OnePoll and Zipcar conducted research that revealed that a quarter of
          Americans have never visited famous US landmarks [1].
        </p>

        <p>
          The research as reported by Matt Hilburn reveals that more than 8 out
          of 10 had Americans never been to the Grand Canyon and close to 8 out
          10 Americans had never been to Niagara Falls.
        </p>

        <p>Many had never even visited the landmarks in their own cities.</p>

        <p>
          Yet most of the research participants claimed they would love to go
          out more, to visit both the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, and
          Yellowstone National Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          They blamed economic difficulties and stringent workplace conditions
          as their main obstructions, yet they never seized to go to new
          restaurants and coffee shops on regular basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          But ecotourism is just what the world needs to create the much-needed
          genuine personal appreciation of nature in people, which enables the
          pressing need for the conservation of nature to truly become a
          personal belief and not something people accept because it is
          constantly being ripped off by news reporters.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s usually the people with firsthand experiences of just how
          beautiful this earth could be without the intrusion of environmentally
          unfriendly, “marvelous” constructions we are used to feasting our eyes
          on in large metropolitan areas, whose calls for the conservation of
          nature are genuine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through firsthand experiences, they understand that this earth which
          offers nearly eight billion of us a home can produce extraordinary
          beauty and deserves real protection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jean Holy Smithereens, for instance, described an experience during a
          visit to the Grand Canyon as “one of those moments that [she] saw with
          [her] own eyes that Nature is still the best architect ever” [2].
        </p>

        <p>
          Many movements and organizations, both governmental and
          non-governmental, work towards the conservation of the earth’s natural
          treasure sites and endangered habitats. And many of these habitats are
          some of the most beautiful places to ever behold.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a 2017 article on their website, CNN lists about 50 natural wonders
          of the earth worth visiting [3].
        </p>

        <p>
          Visiting these natural wonders could awaken some form of earth
          conservation consciousness in tourists, and probably make them
          voluntarily participate in and support the activities of nature
          conservation organizations through public activism and patronage by
          donations and contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many nature resorts go a long way to protect their environments while
          making them attractive to tourists by offering leisure such as
          world-class accommodation with exquisite food and stable electricity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of these resorts offer five-star hospitality services for those
          looking to have the time of their lives. To keep running, they need
          more patronage from nature enthusiasts and tourists to maintain and
          fund their businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          An example is the Sense Resort Khao Kho, a five-star hospitality
          resort located in one of Thailand’s mountainous marvels. Their
          extraordinary services and the exquisite display of nature’s beauty
          would generate euphoria and ecstasy in the hearts of even the most
          skeptical tourists [4].
        </p>
        <p>
          Around most natural resorts and conservation sites in rural areas,
          many educational and community-building activities promote the growth
          of rural communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tourists, through the influx of cash they bring, will not only help
          such local communities grow but also gain exposure to new cultures,
          languages, and art, and could also enjoy exotic cuisine in the process
          of enjoying the natural attractions and landscapes in those places.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tourists get to meet new and different people and possibly build
          friendships that could last a lifetime.
        </p>

        <p>
          One such example is the Feel Free Center in Gambia, based in Jinack
          Niji, a coastal village in the Gambia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aside from offering hospitality services to tourists, they
          also “partner closely with community leaders and villagers ... to
          develop sustainable environmental conservation and ecotourism
          projects” [5].
        </p>

        <p>
          Among many things, they are involved in various health initiatives and
          aid programs and work to promote education and skills acquisition
          among girls.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is essential to awaken the consciousness and love of nature in
          people. One of the best ways to achieve this is to encourage people to
          patronize natural resorts and tourist attractions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Promoting ecotourism among the populace will engender positive
          educational and holistic effects on the tourists themselves, and also
          boost the economy of local and rural regions that offer such natural
          attractions, and help to expose them to visitors from different parts
          of the world.
