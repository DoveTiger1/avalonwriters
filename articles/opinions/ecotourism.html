      Why More People Should Engage In Ecotourism If you had to guess what
      choice most people would make if they were asked to choose between
      strolling for sight-seeing across streets with exquisite buildings as you
      would find in Dubai, Paris, London, etc., or strolling across landscapes
      of unadulterated natural beauty such as lakes, beaches, mountains, virgin
      forests, etc., what would be your answer? Well, here’s the truth. Most
      people would claim they’d love to go to the natural places, to get close
      to nature, to see the Grand Canyon, the Yellowstone, the Amazon, etc. But
      if a real opportunity arises to go on vacation, they’re off to Dubai,
      London, Paris, etc. They suddenly want to see the Big Apple. Yes, there’s
      only one New York, you know. We all claim we love nature, want to conserve
      it, and want to get close to it and understand it. But it’s mostly lip
      service. It’s been observed that many people have very little knowledge
      about the earth’s geography outside the localities where they work and
      live. Most get stuck in the concepts they drew from high school geography
      which were mostly immature and incomplete then and which continue to get
      more muddled as they grow older. With such ephemeral conceptions of the
      geographical features of our home planet, it’s not difficult to imagine
      that there’s even greater ignorance about the natural treasures of the
      earth, the exquisite and exotic resorts of nature, and the endangered
      habitats with their unique plant and animal species. Worse still, the
      average American for instance has hardly even visited many of the
      protected natural sites and geographical treasures within the US, let
      alone those outside the US. OnePoll and Zipcar conducted research that
      revealed that one in four Americans have never visited famous US landmarks
      [1]. The research as reported by Matt Hilburn reveals that 82 percent had
      never been to the Grand Canyon while 77 percent had never been to Niagara
      Falls. Many had never even visited the landmarks in their own cities. Yet
      most of the research participants claimed they would love to go out more,
      to visit both the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, and Yellowstone National
      Park, but blamed economic difficulties and stringent workplace conditions
      as their main obstructions, yet they never seized to go to new restaurants
      and coffee shops on regular basis. But ecotourism is just what the world
      needs to create the much-needed genuine personal appreciation of nature in
      people, which enables the pressing need for the conservation of nature to
      truly become a personal belief and not something people accept because it
      is constantly being ripped off by news reporters. It’s usually the people
      with firsthand experiences of just how beautiful this earth could be
      without the intrusion of environmentally unfriendly, “marvelous”
      constructions we are used to feasting our eyes on in large metropolitan
      areas, whose calls for the conservation of nature are genuine. Through
      firsthand experiences, they understand that this earth which has offered
      nearly eight billion of us a home can produce extraordinary beauty and
      deserves real protection. Jean Holy Smithereens described an experience
      during a visit to the Grand Canyon as “one of those moments that [she] saw
      with [her] own eyes that Nature is still the best architect ever” [2].
      Many movements and organizations, both governmental and non-governmental,
      work towards the conservation of the earth’s natural treasure sites and
      endangered habitats. Many of these are some of the most beautiful places
      to ever behold. In a 2017 article on their website, CNN lists about 50
      natural wonders of the earth worth visiting [3]. Visiting these
      natural wonders could awaken some form of earth conservation consciousness
      in tourists, and probably make them voluntarily participate in and support
      the activities of nature conservation organizations through activism and
      patronage by donations and contributions. Many nature resorts go a long
      way to protect their environments while making them attractive to tourists
      by offering leisure such as world-class accommodation with exquisite food
      and stable electricity. Many of these resorts offer five-star hospitality
      services for those looking to have the time of their lives. To keep
      running, they need more patronage from nature enthusiasts and tourists to
      maintain and fund their business models.  An example is the Sense Resort
      Khao Kho, an incredible five-star hospitality resort located in one of
      Thailand’s extraordinary mountainous marvels. Their extraordinary services
      and the exquisite display of nature’s beauty would generate euphoria and
      ecstasy in the hearts of even the most skeptical tourists [4]. Around most
      natural resorts and conservation sites in rural areas, many educational
      and community-building activities promote the growth of rural communities.
      Tourists, through the influx of cash they bring, will not only help such
      local communities grow but also gain exposure to new cultures,
      languages, and art, and could also enjoy exotic cuisine in the process of
      enjoying the natural attractions and landscapes in the tourist locations.
      They get to meet new and different people and possibly build friendships
      that could last a lifetime. One such example is the Feel Free Center in
      Gambia, based in Jinack Niji, a coastal village in the Gambia. Aside from
      offering hospitality services to tourists, they also “partner closely with
      community leaders and villagers… to develop sustainable environmental
      conservation and ecotourism projects” [5]. Among many things, they are
      involved in various health initiatives and aid programs and work to
      promote education and skills acquisition among girls. It is essential to
      awaken the consciousness and love of nature in people. One of the best
      ways to achieve this is to encourage people to patronize natural resorts
      and tourist attractions. Promoting ecotourism among the populace will not
      only engender positive educational and holistic effects on the tourists
      themselves, but will also boost the economy of local and rural regions
      that offer such natural attractions, and help to expose them to visitors
      from different parts of the world. FOOTNOTES [1]Hilburn, M., Evans, J., &
