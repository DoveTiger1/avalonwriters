        <h2>How to turn your life into a beautiful story</h2>
        <h4>by Chukwuma Chibuike</h4>

        <p>
          Everyone's life is a unique story based artwork. Each of the eight
          billion people on earth is making an incredible story with their life
          on a daily basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are all living a true life story where everyone of us is a
          protagonist. And these life stories are written only as we act them
          out in our daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we have to ask ourselves a question: have we, so far, written the
          stories we like? Stories we like enough to retell with pride?
        </p>

        <p>
          If we are being honest here we should confirm that many of us are not
          really happy with the stories we've written with our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          But we must learn the lessons we earned through our life choices,
          whether we love the stories we made our lives into through these
          choices or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we must then strive to create new stories from now going forward,
          by doing new things and sowing new seeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          We just have to make sure, we are now writing stories we will be happy
          to retell to others.
        </p>

        <p>But then, what would a great life story be like?</p>

        <p>
          Though it is very vital to have a lot of money, it wouldn't be correct
          to measure the quality of our lives based on affluence alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          A better metric for assessing the qualities of our personal stories
          should be our own actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is even more true when we consider that there are people who may
          not necessarily be described as wealthy, but who have lived richer and
          fuller lives than some wealthy people.
        </p>

        <p>
          This kind of people, admirable as they are, can be described as being
          rich in experiences. <br />
          They really do have wealth, but of an intangible kind.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            So what matters in a person's life is determined by what the person
            loves. What others love is secondary to him. Therefore, each of us
            must learn to do what makes us happy.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a big shot accountant in a Wall Street hedge fund who spends
          all his days chugging out numbers, for example.
        </p>

        <p>
          He may earn seven figures a year, live in a penthouse, and have little
          time for niceties even though he buys all of them with his money. For
          him it might be all about the money. After all, money they say, is
          very vital.
        </p>

        <p>
          But now think of a cool dude who works in a bar and has cool friends
          and loves to party and paint graffiti, and who goes skydiving once
          every month. Cool, right?
        </p>

        <p>
          He might not be doing the popular school kid's dream job. But with our
          adult eyes, we may confess that he probably makes bartending look
          awesome.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or what about a gentle Mike, married with three kids - two girls and a
          boy, whom he loves to take to his evangelical church services every
          Sunday, so he can connect to his faith and wind down from his weekly
          job as the procurement officer for a construction firm.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of these three people listed above, you wouldn't be surprised to know
          that different people could go for any of them as their ideal life.
          And this is based on personal preference.
        </p>

        <p>
          So there's no one cap fits all here. Money is good and vital but is
          not everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            It wouldn't shock you to realize that not everyone wants to be an
            Elon Musk. Some people might find his life too fast paced.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            As long as you are happy doing what you do, then you are writing a
            good story with your life. Maybe.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>It doesn't matter if you are wealthy or not.</p>

        <p>
          Now back to the question of good stories, it boils down on two things:
          <em> what makes us happy, and our actions each moment. </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          What is the quality of our actions. From the biggest most important,
          to the tiniest, most trivial things we do: are they of absolute
          superior quality?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast lives always come to mind when people think about what it means
          to live a full life.
        </p>
        <p>
          “But wait a minute,” you would ask them, “if it's all about fast
          lives, does a Tibetan monk not live a full life then?”
        </p>

        <p>
          You have to ask because monks have a reputation for living very
          slow-paced lives. They put all their emphasis on mindfulness, i.e.,
          being absolutely aware of yourself and your surroundings inside out,
          in the present moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          And being in the presence of Buddhist monks sometimes makes you
          super-conscious; you feel like you are coming alive for the first
          time. And these are people with very slow lives which many of us might
          even regard as downright boring and monotonous.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it can't be all about speed and fast pace, deadlines, high-pressure
          jobs, all night parties in Ibiza, skydiving, etc. Anyone can make any
          lifestyle work for him meaningfully.
        </p>
        <p>It totally depends on what's valuable to him.</p>

        <p>
          The nuances of what makes a good life story seem to follow blurred
          lines, but a closer look brings them back to the same point:
          <em style="background-color: yellowgreen">
            our actions, not even happiness.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>Moment by moment, what is the quality of our actions?</p>

        <p>
          Life coach Jeff Lerner once said that he always asks himself a
          question about what he calls his three <em>P</em>s in life. One P
          stands for “physical”, the next for “personal”, and the last for
          “professional”.
        </p>

        <p>
          For each passing moment he likes to know what he is doing to enhance
          himself in any one of these arenas of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          In other words, as Tom Bilyeu, founder of The Impact Theory puts it,
          at any given moment, he's either engaging with family or friends
          (personal), resting or working out (physical), or working
          (professional).
        </p>

        <p>
          No moment is ever meant to be wasted on nothing. He must be engaged in
          something productive and valuable.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Napoleon Hill says, we must have a definite chief aim. A primary
          driving desire or theme around which our lives are centred.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because desire is the fuel that burns in a man's heart. A man without
          desire is like a car without fuel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our desires drive our actions, our actions produce consequences or
          results, and the results determine circumstances and life situations
          we have to live in.
        </p>

        <p>And our life circumstances define happiness or its absence.</p>

        <p>
          In his book on The Power of Self-Discipline, Brian Tracy explains that
          we all have two figurative voices speaking to us. One from each
          shoulder: an angel on the right, and a devil on the left.
        </p>

        <p>
          The devil urges us to be lazy and irresponsible, to do what's easy,
          fun and expedient.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the angel urges us to be responsible, to do the important but
          difficult tasks that will lead us towards the future we envisage.
        </p>

        <p>
          But sometimes, some no-good people are born into luck, wealth and
          fortune. They could inherit some money, or even win a jackpot. And as
          a consequence, they could be very happy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meaning that sometimes, you could see happy people who are very
          superficial.
        </p>

        <p>
          And this brings us back to the main point - that it's never all about
          happiness but the about the quality of our actions, minute by minute.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's true that in most cases, right actions will always end up leading
          to happiness, but we must never forget the process that led to such
          happiness in the cases where people had to wade through bitter
          adversity.
        </p>

        <p>
          And this buttresses the point that the true quality of a life story
          can really only be measured by the quality of our actions, moment by
          moment. And not whether we have earned happiness through them yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that even unhappy people can also be writing wonderful stories
          with their lives while they are still unhappy, i.e., even before
          achieving happiness, or even if they don't end up achieving happiness.
        </p>

        <p>And history is filled with such examples.</p>

        <p>
          For many have lived through terrible circumstances while managing to
          retain their humanity all through and to still believe that there is
          goodness in people.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nelson Mandela for instance was unjustly imprisoned for twenty-seven
          years. But while in prison, he refused to hate his captors, and
          quickly forgave them the moment he was released.
        </p>

        <p>That's a beautiful life story.</p>

        <p>We may not all be Mandelas.</p>

        <p>
          Neither will everyone who has to live through more or less comparable
          adversity end up having a glorious turnaround like he did, (Mandela
          became the first black president of non-apartheid South Africa).
        </p>

        <p>But he's choices are worthy of emulation.</p>

        <p>
          So if a beautiful life story depends on our actions and not on
          circumstances we have no control over, it goes to say that we have to
          become so conscious of what we do now that twenty years later, when we
          might've become more mature, looking back will evoke a sure feeling
          that we'd never have done it differently and that we'd gladly do it
          the same way over and over.
        </p>

        <p>
          So
          <em
            >“the quality of your actions and not your circumstances determine
            the quality of your life story.”</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>We must therefore, try to act only in ways we can be proud of.</p>

        <p>
          An exotic adage says that the man who always tells the truth does not
          need to remember everything he said because he is rest assured that if
          he said anything anywhere, it must have been true, based on the
          information available to him at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          And same goes for us if we start choosing to act only in the best
          possible ways in every moment:
        </p>

        <p>
          Time comes when regardless of external circumstances, we can always
          look back with pride, knowing that we always did the right thing where
          we were and how we could.
        </p>

        <p>
          We always made the best lemonade we could with the lemons life gave
          us.
        </p>

        <p>
          And such life, with or without affluence, would certainly be a story
          we could tell anyone, wherever and whenever, and
